§ Transaction-based model of memory
	– Interface:
		start transaction(); read/write data commit transaction():
	– If conflicts detected, commit will abort and must be retried – What is a conflict?
		» If values you read are written by others before commit § Hardware support for transactions
	– Typically uses cache coherence protocol to help process
